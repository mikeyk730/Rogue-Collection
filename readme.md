Rog-O-Matic
-----------
Watch an [AI from the early 1980s](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/papers/rogomatic.html) put your skills to shame.  Rogomatic speeds through the dungeons of Unix Rogue.  Using a genetic algorithm, Rogomatic learns from every game it plays.  Will you witness it become a total winner?

Rogomatic was coded to play the following versions, so it should do quite well:
+ Unix Rogue v3.6.3
+ Unix Rogue v5.2.1
+ Unix Rogue v5.4.2

Starting in 3.0.5 you can run Rogomatic against the remaining versions. It doesn't have any specific tactics for the PC versions, so it may get confused by the new features and monsters:
+ Unix Rogue v5.3 
+ PC Rogue v1.1
+ PC Rogue v1.48
