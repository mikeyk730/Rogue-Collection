<h1 align=center>ROGUE 5.4</h1>

<hr>
<a name="NAME"></a>
<h2>NAME</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>rogue54 &minus; Exploring The Dungeons of Doom</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p><b>rogue54</b> [ <b>&minus;r</b> ] [
<i>save_file</i> ] [ <b>&minus;s</b> ] [ <b>&minus;d</b>
]</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p align="justify"><i>Rogue</i> is a computer fantasy game with a new twist.
It is crt oriented and the object of the game is to survive
the attacks of various monsters and get a lot of gold,
rather than the puzzle solving orientation of most computer
fantasy games.</p>
	<p align="justify">To get started you really only need to know two commands.
The command <b>?</b> will give you a list of the available
commands and the command <b>/</b> will identify the things
you see on the screen.</p>
	<p align="justify">To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat
other people&rsquo;s high scores) you must locate the Amulet
of Yendor which is somewhere below the 20th level of the
dungeon and get it out. Nobody has achieved this yet and if
somebody does, they will probably go down in history as a
hero among heroes.</p>
	<p align="justify">When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit,
or if you (by some miracle) manage to win, <i>rogue</i> will
give you a list of the top-ten scorers. The scoring is based
entirely upon how much gold you get. There is a 10% penalty
for getting yourself killed.</p>
	<p align="justify">If <i>save_file</i> is specified, rogue will be restored
from the specified saved game file. If the <b>&minus;r</b>
option is used, the save game file is presumed to be the
default.</p>
	<p align="justify">The <b>&minus;s</b> option will print out the list of
scores.</p>
	<p align="justify">The <b>&minus;d</b> option will kill you and try to add
you to the score file.</p>
	<p align="justify">For more detailed directions, read the document <i>A
Guide to the Dungeons of Doom.</i></p>

<h2>BUGS</h2>
<p>Probably infinite (although countably infinite). However,
that Ice Monsters sometimes transfix you permanently is
<i>not</i> a bug. It&rsquo;s a feature.</p>
